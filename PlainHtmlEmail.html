<p>Hi INSERT_FIRST_NAME,<br/>
As your new PMA General Manager for Southern Africa, Iâ€™d like to personally invite you to join me at this year's 
<a href="http://www.pma.com/events/fresh-connections-southern-africa" target="_blank">PMA Fresh Connections: Southern Africa</a> Conference &amp; Expo&nbsp;on 17-18&nbsp;August at the CSIR Pretoria.
</p>
<p>Last year, over 500&nbsp;industry leaders from South Africa, Africa and internationally came together across the fresh produce supply chain for two very productive days of networking, 
    education and a state-of-the-art expo.&nbsp;There is no other conference and expo like this in the region and your voice is important to the conversation this year regarding the 
    future of fresh produce.
</p>
<p>
    We've already lined up a series of excellent session topics designed with you in mind which you can review 
    <a  href="http://www.pma.com/events/fresh-connections-southern-africa/attendees/schedule" target="_blank">here</a>. We are pleased to announce&nbsp;two excellent keynote speakers with this launch:
</p>    
<ul>
    <li>Dave Corsi, Vice President of Produce &amp; Floral, Wegmans (U.S.)</li>
    <li>Bryan Silbermann, CEO, Produce Marketing Association (U.S.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
    We will announce additional speakers for the rest of the sessions soon. Register&nbsp;today and don't forget to tell your colleagues about this remarkable conference.
</p>
<p>
    We also have <a href="http://www.pma.com/events/fresh-connections-southern-africa/sponsors" target="_blank">Sponsorship</a>
